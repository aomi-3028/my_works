The popularity of superhero comic books declined following World War II,[22] while comic book sales continued to increase as other genres proliferated, such as romance, westerns, crime, horror, and humour.[23] Following a sales peak in the early 1950s, the content of comic books (particularly crime and horror) was subjected to scrutiny from parent groups and government agencies, which culminated in Senate hearings that led to the establishment of the Comics Code Authority self-censoring body.[24] The Code has been blamed for stunting the growth of American comics and maintaining its low status in American society for much of the remainder of the century.[25] Superheroes re-established themselves as the most prominent comic book genre by the early 1960s.[26] Underground comix challenged the Code and readers with adult, countercultural content in the late 1960s and early 1970s.[27] The underground gave birth to the alternative comics movement in the 1980s and its mature, often experimental content in non-superhero genres.[28]
Comics in the US has had a lowbrow reputation stemming from its roots in mass culture; cultural elites sometimes saw popular culture as threatening culture and society. In the latter half of the 20th century, popular culture won greater acceptance, and the lines between high and low culture began to blur. Comics nevertheless continued to be stigmatized, as the medium was seen as entertainment for children and illiterates.[29]
The graphic novel—book-length comics—began to gain attention after Will Eisner popularized the term with his book A Contract with God (1978).[30] The term became widely known with the public after the commercial success of Maus, Watchmen, and The Dark Knight Returns in the mid-1980s.[31] In the 21st century graphic novels became established in mainstream bookstores[32] and libraries[33] and webcomics became common.
