The francophone Swiss Rodolphe Töpffer produced comic strips beginning in 1827,[7] and published theories behind the form.[35] Cartoons appeared widely in newspapers and magazines from the 19th century.[36] The success of Zig et Puce in 1925 popularized the use of speech balloons in European comics, after which Franco-Belgian comics began to dominate.[37] The Adventures of Tintin, with its signature clear line style,[38] was first serialized in newspaper comics supplements beginning in 1929,[39] and became an icon of Franco-Belgian comics.[40]
Following the success of Le Journal de Mickey (est. 1934),[41] dedicated comics magazines[42] like Spirou (est. 1938) and Tintin (1946-1993), and full-colour comic albums became the primary outlet for comics in the mid-20th century.[43] As in the US, at the time comics were seen as infantile and a threat to culture and literacy; commentators stated that "none bear up to the slightest serious analysis",[c] and that comics were "the sabotage of all art and all literature".[45][d]
In the 1960s, the term bandes dessinées ("drawn strips") came into wide use in French to denote the medium.[46] Cartoonists began creating comics for mature audiences,[47] and the term "Ninth Art"[e] was coined, as comics began to attract public and academic attention as an artform.[48] A group including René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo founded the magazine Pilote in 1959 to give artists greater freedom over their work. Goscinny and Uderzo's The Adventures of Asterix appeared in it[49] and went on to become the best-selling French-language comics series.[50] From 1960, the satirical and taboo-breaking Hara-Kiri defied censorship laws in the countercultural spirit that led to the May 1968 events.[51]
Frustration with censorship and editorial interference led to a group of Pilote cartoonists to found the adults-only L'Écho des savanes in 1972. Adult-oriented and experimental comics flourished in the 1970s, such as in the experimental science fiction of Mœbius and others in Métal hurlant, even mainstream publishers took to publishing prestige-format adult comics.[52]
From the 1980s, mainstream sensibilities were reasserted and serialization became less common as the number of comics magazines decreased and many comics began to be published directly as albums.[53] Smaller publishers such as L'Association[54] that published longer works[55] in non-traditional formats[56] by auteur-istic creators also became common. Since the 1990s, mergers resulted in fewer large publishers, while smaller publishers proliferated. Sales overall continued to grow despite the trend towards a shrinking print market.[57]
