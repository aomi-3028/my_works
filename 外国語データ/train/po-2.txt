The European, American, and Japanese comics traditions have followed different paths.[1] 
Europeans have seen their tradition as beginning with the Swiss Rodolphe Töpffer from as 
early as 1827 and Americans have seen the origin of theirs in Richard F. Outcault's 1890s 
newspaper strip The Yellow Kid, though many Americans have come to recognize Töpffer's 
precedence.[2] Japan has a long history of satirical cartoons and comics leading up to the 
World War II era. The ukiyo-e artist Hokusai popularized the Japanese term for comics and 
cartooning, manga, in the early 19th century.[3] In the 1930s Harry "A" Chesler started a 
comics studio, which eventually at its height employed 40 artists working for 50 different 
publishers who helped make the comics medium flourish in "the Golden Age of Comics" after 
World War II.[4] In the post-war era modern Japanese comics began to flourish when Osamu 
Tezuka produced a prolific body of work.[5] Towards the close of the 20th century, these 
three traditions converged in a trend towards book-length comics: the comic album in Europe, 
the tankōbon[a] in Japan, and the graphic novel in the English-speaking countries.[1]
Outside of these genealogies, comics theorists and historians have seen precedents for comics 
in the Lascaux cave paintings[6] in France (some of which appear to be chronological 
sequences of images), Egyptian hieroglyphs, Trajan's Column in Rome,[7] the 11th-century 
Norman Bayeux Tapestry,[8] the 1370 bois Protat woodcut, the 15th-century Ars moriendi 
and block books, Michelangelo's The Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel,[7] and William 
Hogarth's 18th-century sequential engravings,[9] amongst others
Illustrated humour periodicals were popular in 19th-century Britain, the earliest of which was 
the short-lived The Glasgow Looking Glass in 1825. The most popular was Punch,[11] which 
popularized the term cartoon for its humorous caricatures.[12] On occasion the cartoons in
these magazines appeared in sequences;[11] the character Ally Sloper featured in the earliest 
serialized comic strip when the character began to feature in its own weekly magazine in 
1884.[13]
American comics developed out of such magazines as Puck, Judge, and Life. The success of 
illustrated humour supplements in the New York World and later the New York American, 
particularly Outcault's The Yellow Kid, led to the development of newspaper comic strips. 
Early Sunday strips were full-page[14] and often in colour. Between 1896 and 1901 
cartoonists experimented with sequentiality, movement, and speech balloons.[15] An 
example is Gustave Verbeek, who wrote his comic series "The UpsideDowns of Old Man 
Muffaroo and Little Lady Lovekins" between 1903 and 1905. These comics were made in such 
a way that one could read the 6-panel comic, flip the book and keep reading. He made 64 such 
comics in total. In 2012 a remake of a selection of the comics was made by Marcus Ivarsson 
in the book 'In Uppåner med Lilla Lisen & Gamle Muppen'.
