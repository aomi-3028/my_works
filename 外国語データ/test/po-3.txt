Coulton Waugh attempted the first comprehensive history of American comics with The Comics (1947).[106] Will Eisner's Comics and Sequential Art (1985) and Scott McCloud's Understanding Comics (1993) were early attempts in English to formalize the study of comics. David Carrier's The Aesthetics of Comics (2000) was the first full-length treatment of comics from a philosophical perspective.[107] Prominent American attempts at definitions of comics include Eisner's, McCloud's, and Harvey's. Eisner described what he called "sequential art" as "the arrangement of pictures or images and words to narrate a story or dramatize an idea";[108] Scott McCloud defined comics as "juxtaposed pictorial and other images in deliberate sequence, intended to convey information and/or to produce an aesthetic response in the viewer",[109] a strictly formal definition which detached comics from its historical and cultural trappings.[110] R.C. Harvey defined comics as "pictorial narratives or expositions in which words (often lettered into the picture area within speech balloons) usually contribute to the meaning of the pictures and vice versa".[111] Each definition has had its detractors. Harvey saw McCloud's definition as excluding single-panel cartoons,[112] and objected to McCloud's de-emphasizing verbal elements, insisting "the essential characteristic of comics is the incorporation of verbal content".[98] Aaron Meskin saw McCloud's theories as an artificial attempt to legitimize the place of comics in art history.[91]
Cross-cultural study of comics is complicated by the great difference in meaning and scope of the words for "comics" in different languages.[113] The French term for comics, bandes dessin√©es ("drawn strip") emphasizes the juxtaposition of drawn images as a defining factor,[114] which can imply the exclusion of even photographic comics.[115] The term manga is used in Japanese to indicate all forms of comics, cartooning,[116] and caricature.[113]
