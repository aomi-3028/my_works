Book-length comics take different forms in different cultures. European comic albums are most commonly printed in A4-size[78] colour volumes.[43] In English-speaking countries, the trade paperback format originating from collected comic books have also been chosen for original material. Otherwise, bound volumes of comics are called graphic novels and are available in various formats. Despite incorporating the term "novel"—a term normally associated with fiction—"graphic novel" also refers to non-fiction and collections of short works.[79] Japanese comics are collected in volumes called tankōbon following magazine serialization.[80]
Gag and editorial cartoons usually consist of a single panel, often incorporating a caption or speech balloon. Definitions of comics which emphasize sequence usually exclude gag, editorial, and other single-panel cartoons; they can be included in definitions that emphasize the combination of word and image.[81] Gag cartoons first began to proliferate in broadsheets published in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the term "cartoon"[h] was first used to describe them in 1843 in the British humour magazine Punch.[12]
Webcomics are comics that are available on the internet. They are able to reach large audiences, and new readers usually can access archived installments.[82] Webcomics can make use of an infinite canvas—meaning they are not constrained by size or dimensions of a page.[83]
Some consider storyboards[84] and wordless novels to be comics.[85] Film studios, especially in animation, often use sequences of images as guides for film sequences. These storyboards are not intended as an end product and are rarely seen by the public.[84] Wordless novels are books which use sequences of captionless images to deliver a narrative.[86]
